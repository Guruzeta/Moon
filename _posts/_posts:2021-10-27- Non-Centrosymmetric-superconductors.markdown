# Abstract
<!-- States formed by pairing in a superconductor can be classified according to their parity (for even frequency), namely
as even or odd parity (singlet or triplet respectively). However, this classification, relies on the presence of an inversion centre. -->

Lack of inversion symmetry in a crystal can have very
profound impact on its superconducting properties. The free-energy functionals describing these, so-called non-
centrosymmetric systems, can have new terms which are absent in ordinary superconductors on account of symmetry. Among
other things, while in ordinary superconductors the externally applied field decays monotonically, in a
noncentrosymmetric superconductor it can have spiral decay (imagine $\vec{B}$ rotating and decaying, much like a   
  helix). Moreover, they also exhibit vortex bound states, and a novel pairing state characterized by an admixture of
singlet-triplet pairings. In the first part of my thesis, I studied one such model ([PhysRevB.102.184517](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.102.184517), Babaev et al.) and looked at the effect of "spin-orbit
coupling" (SOC, present in these materials because of inversion breaking). Specifically, I investigated SOC's effect
on observables both below and above $T_c$ (when the system is non-superconducting). For the latter, mean field predicts a vanishing order parameter (and thus a normal state), but thermal fluctuations atop this mean field can still contribute to thermodynamic measurables (in some cases, their contribution can overpower normal "metallic" state answer, see larkin's paper below). Using regularization, I calculated these effects and finally presented my findings to a committee.
