Master thesis on characterizing Superconductor - Weyl Semimetal junctions.


Problem statement: I along with Prof. Hridis Pal of the physics department @IITB are interested in looking at the
physics of Weyl semimetal-Superconductor junctions and develop a thorough understanding of the non-trivial dynamics
endowed by "surface states" on the junction. This problem could have experimental significance on account on surging
interest in Topological quantum matter and their non-trivial properties. I hope to gain deeper understanding of this
phenomena in the coming months.
