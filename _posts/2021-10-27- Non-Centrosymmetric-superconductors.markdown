Bachelor thesis report on superconductivity.

# Abstract
<!-- States formed by pairing in a superconductor can be classified according to their parity (for even frequency), namely
as even or odd parity (singlet or triplet respectively). However, this classification, relies on the presence of an inversion centre. -->

Lack of inversion symmetry in a crystal can have very profound impact on its
superconducting properties. The free-energy functionals describing these,
so-called non-centrosymmetric systems (**NCS**), can have new terms which are absent in ordinary superconductors
on account of symmetry. While externally applied field decays monotonically for usual BCS, in NCS
it can have a **spiral** **decay** (imagine $$ \vec{B} $$ rotating and decaying, much like a   
helix). Moreover, these materials also feature vortex bound states, and an admixture of
singlet-triplet pairings. I studied one such model ([PhysRevB.102.184517](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.102.184517), Babaev et al.) and looked at the effect of "**spin**-**orbit**
**coupling**" on superconductivity. Specifically, I investigated SOC's effect
on observables both below and above $$ T_c $$ (when the system is non-superconducting). For the latter, mean field predicts a vanishing order parameter (and thus a normal state), but thermal **fluctuations** atop this mean field can still contribute to thermodynamic measurables (in some cases, their contribution can **overpower** normal "metallic" state answer, see larkin's paper below). Using regularization, I calculated these effects and finally presented my findings to a committee.
