Hey there! I am currently working my nights on learning Keldysh Field theory for condensed matter systems. The real time situation is
me learning about path integrals and gaining on the alternative approach to field quantization via functional quantization.
I'll share the notes soon updating my progress therein.


# Update: 2
So I finally went into Keldysh field theory. One of the main ideas of the theory is to allow the case for non-adiabatic interactions i.e. one can ramp up a time varying external field that will drive the system away from equilibrium.

From what I've read about this, for equilibrium situations this fact is neatly avoided by pleading the following fact:
\\(|GS>\\) = \\(U_{t,-\\infty}\\) \\(|0>\\)


# Update: 1

Till now i've mostly been going through Prof. Sensarma's lectures on doing path integrals via the
imaginary time formalism. For a complete overview, look at the following overview of his concise lectures on path integral:-
[Path Integrals In Quantum Mechanics](https://theory.tifr.res.in/~sensarma/courses/ADVQMLNOTE/pathint.html)

I'm currently at lecture 24th of this series. Apart from that, I've made some notes that make the idea
of propagator precise as advertised in his lecture \\(22^{nd}\\). Kleinert's sections on \\(x^4\\).
I'm currently wondering about how to calculate the real time propagator using the same( I might be confusing the calculation of partition function with the same).

Apart from that, some work on why green's functions are relevant quantities experimentally is due. The apocryphal message of the Green's function as being a relevant experimental quantity is something i'd like to see. Further updates to follow.
