As the title reads here I wish to digress a little bit into why does one care about Green's functions other than as a tool for getting around complicated PDE's(read E&M-T). Though a digression, I'll try to mention the broad areas where Green's function can give a clue to the physics of a system and decrypt the adage " The Language of Many body physics is Green's Functions" (well tbh, this adage is only found in some textbooks and in conferences, but again, why not?).

So to my knowledge, Green's functions are used in the following areas:

1. As a first object calculated to yield scattering cross sections in relativistic field theories (e.g. $$ \phi^4 $$ ) )
