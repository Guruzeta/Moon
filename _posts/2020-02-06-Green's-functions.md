As the title reads here I wish to digress a little bit into why does one care about Green's functions, other than as a tool for solving PDE's(read E&M).
Though a digression, I'll try to mention the broad areas where Green's function
can give a clue to the physics of a system. In fact, recently I came across a
video that iterated the line "The language of Many body physics is Green's functions".
Hopefully this short exposition of mine can help to decrypt some of these "shower"
thoughts that I've been having.

So to my current knowledge, Green's functions are used in the following areas:

1. As a first object calculated to yield scattering cross sections in relativistic field theories (e.g. $$ \phi^4 $$ theory) and to calculate S-matrix elements.

2. As a tool to calculate the linear response of a quantum system, mostly
compacted by Kubo's formula.( Why is it important?)

3. In the context of Keldysh f.t., $$ G^{>} $$ and $$ G^{<} $$ seem to capture the
one-particle dynamics of the system. I am currently planning to delve into this,
while some revision will help to clarify the above points more clearly.
For the interested souls, this point is exemplified in the treatise "Quantum Statistical
Mechanics" by Kadanoff and Baym.

As clearly evident, this post requires some concrete explanation and hopefully
I'll cover points 2 and 3 by the end of this week.
