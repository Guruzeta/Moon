A Work in progress - Question to ponder: Why are vortices present in a superconductor?
If so, why are they interesting?
Spoilers: They tend to interact! (Imagine small spinning tops crashing against
  one another during a childhood game. Umm.... Do the vortices spin too?)

Keywords to watch: Phase transitions, anderson-higgs mechanism,
berezinskii-kosterlitz-thouless transition.

Will put up the post soon!
