The reader of this page will have to suffer through my terrible drawing skills
until I figure out how to setup a separate personal page. Here is one:

I was looking at ways to pickup drawing again and I found this rather relevant advice
being iterated on the very 1st module of an online course:

>Thankfully, nobody ever told me I couldn’t draw. Then again, nobody ever told me I could draw.
As an introverted child, I was oblivious to the meaning of the word “talent”. Drawing entertained me for hours and provided me with something everybody needs – a sense of being special....
“Talent” is a word often misunderstood. Talented artists are often presented to us through movies, television, and media as magical and mysterious eccentrics. In the art world, you often hear critics hailing such things as random blobs of paint on a canvas, digital accidents, or even human excrement as “great works of art.”
If you’re anything like me, you struggle to understand this art. You’re often left scratching your head, amused and puzzled. The critics encourage you to believe that these artworks are the result of “extraordinary talent”. No wonder so many people believe that talent itself is magical, elusive, and not within the grasp of mere mortals such as us!....
Talent is simply a process of self-discovery in which individuals acknowledge their interest and motivation to become exceptional in a specific area.
Drawing is as natural a human activity as learning to walk or talk. From the ancient caves of prehistoric humans to the tombs of Egyptian and Native peoples all over the world, we have found evidence that humans used art to communicate and immortalize events and objects precious to their lives and cultures. The creators of these ancient artworks were probably not disparaged by self-doubt – they made art because it was the natural thing to do.

Although the advice is tailored towards sketching, I think some of it holds true
for any field that requires immense creative effort. Physics gladly fits the bill.
And truly, I've on occasion met people who think that science is particularly hard
or that it requires some God-gifted superhuman skillset. I think the real answer is
rather dull and boring - if you can spare some hours on it and are comfortable with not
being omniscient, you'll get it! Science, or rather physics in particular, takes
time to master and what's surprising is that you actually never get to finish the
"mastering" part.

One more line that I agree with is the last one - drawing because it was the natural
thing to do. This reminds of the well known Charles Bukowski's advice:**[don't try](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiL-pf_ofztAhUEOSsKHQLTDHIQtwIwAHoECAAQAg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DeMTDAHK-tkE&usg=AOvVaw15mIlMbFVAT1GKgBlvYbcT)**.
