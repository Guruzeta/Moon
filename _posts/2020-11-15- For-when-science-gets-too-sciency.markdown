Being in the middle of a rather unusual semester and a couple of slowly progressing
projects, I've, from time to time, being pushed into fatigue. Moments arise when
physics seems rather monotonuous and one is faced with the particular dilemma of
not having "the juice" to work.
Well, after having spent some fair deal in this bound state, I decided to fruitfully
procrastinate my time venturing into blogs by rather cool (and practicing) scientists. Here are the hits:


1. [Terry Tao's blog](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/)
Checkout the section on career advice - No "zen" like inane platitudes. Practical stuff
ranging from [importance of writing it down](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/write-down-what-youve-done/) to some pretty high-powered mathematics (see [Uncountable measure theory](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2020/10/04/foundational-aspects-of-uncountable-measure-theory-gelfand-duality-riesz-representation-canonical-models-and-canonical-disintegration/)). I'll shamelessly admit that I've
no clue whatsoever of the latter.
Interesting - [complex analysis page](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/category/teaching/246a-complex-analysis/)

2. [John Baez's blog](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez)
Comes from someone who dabbles in both maths & physics (why didn't I find this before?).
Advice on [this](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/) page. Particularly clicked with his thoughts
on being wary of jumping into shiny stuff and doing  theoretical experiments. Also cites several
standard books on physics (similar books have been used in our curriculum).
Point to check - His Math suggests!

3. [Backreaction](http://backreaction.blogspot.com) - I'll leave out this one for you to check.
Sabine Hossenfelder (or "bee" as her blog visitors like to say) is a theoretical physicists working on
quantum gravity. She makes videos too, which sets her apart on this list.
Point to check - Her comment section is clearly something to view. Caution: Might get intense sometimes ;)

4. [Not Even wrong](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/) -
Shares some similar ideas as Sabine, but quite well organised. I like the recent updates made in the page
(see the [2020 nobel prize](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=12009) update).
Peter Woit (a ) shares the same dabble for math-physics as John Baez, hence makes an interesting read for knowing about "current news" in both fields.

Others like [Scott Aaronson's](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=304), [Lubos Motl's](https://motls.blogspot.com) seemed popular - have only made a slight venture. A more complete index can be found
at [Prof. Woit's blog](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/) (down-right in his page).
