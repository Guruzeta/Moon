## Post from 2019

Recently I've ventured into quantum field theory over the course of a supervised learning.
I've managed to cover topics such as Classical Field theory, Canonical Quantization and
perturbation theory basics. I intend to cover much more and get a feel for the depth of this
field. I am following the path of *Peskin and Schroeder* and have particularly likened
*[David tong's](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qft.html)* excellent lecture notes on the topic.
You can checkout my supervised learning report and presentation for an initial glimpse into the topics that I've covered. They can be found here.
