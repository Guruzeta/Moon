Recently I've ventured into quantum field theory over the course of a supervised learning.
I've managed to cover topics such as Classical Field theory, Canonical Quantization and
perturbation theory basics. I intend to cover much more and get a feel for the depth of this
field. I am following the path of *Peskin and Schroeder* and have particularly likened
*[David tong's](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qft.html)* excellent lecture notes on the topic.
You can checkout my supervised learning report and presentation for an initial glimpse into the topics that I've covered. They can be found here.

This report contains a small sampling of my work during the semester. I intend to post further
developments on this website very soon. Till then, keep your **quantas** real ;).
