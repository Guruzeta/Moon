So it has been almost 3 months since I've penned something on the blog here - partly because
of some commitments (more on that follows below) and partly because of the whole new
online way of going through a sem.

<!---
First off, IIT Bombay decided to opt for an online semester by having virtual classes and
exams. Started off roughly around 3rd week of August, we're currently underway to
end-semesters, with a rather short semester on our hands. Specifics include using popular video
conferencing softwares (or should I say a zoo of shiny looking apps, each of which harbours
some fatal flaws) along with video proctoring for exams. Although a recent survey informs that
the majority (by this I really mean >50%) has found the ordeal quite taxing, I'd say the experience
has been rather bitter-sweet on my end of spectrum. With several pros and cons weighed on opposite ends,
I think a good reason could be labelled to my own preference of working alone that made the logistical
change a small perturbation. My outgoing friends, on the other hand, have had to face this unique reality.
