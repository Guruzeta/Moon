Bachelor thesis report on superconductivity in topological insulator $$ Cu_xBi_2Se_3 $$.

# Abstract
<!-- States formed by pairing in a superconductor can be classified according to their parity (for even frequency), namely
as even or odd parity (singlet or triplet respectively). However, this classification, relies on the presence of an inversion centre. -->

Currently, the phenomenon of superconductivity in $$ M_xBi_2Se_3 $$ has been of some interest (particularly $$ Cu_xBi_2Se_3 $$
which is a doped topological insulator). [2] proposed that the inter-orbital odd parity pairing symmetry in a strongly
spin orbit coupled normal state might be an explanation for the same. As analysed in [2], this can happen only in the
presence of a two component order parameter. However the current understanding still remains
inconclusive on some consequences in lieu of this pairing [3], namely that although the pairing is topological, the search for expected Majorana bound states turned out mixed results. It is in this regard that the current thesis aims to study one aspect
of this problem, namely, the phenomenon of **half quantum vortices** present possible in this material.

The thesis is organized as follows: In chapter 1, half quantum vortices (HQV) are analysed using the framework of Ginzburg
Landau theory. A concrete realisation is highlighted in form of a microscopic model, done in chapter 2. With the model in hand, the calculation of spin-polarization around vortex states is done. A specific case of overlapping HQV pair (as discussed in Chapter 1) is taken and spin-polarization is computed for the same.
