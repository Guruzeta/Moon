I've put up posting this note for sometime. Here it is:

Recently I managed to read something on dualities in Ising model as a part of my
project for a course on Advanced statistical mechanics. The reading involved basically
going over a chapter in Kardar's book on series expansions. I'm supposed to say
something about it here, but you can just click below to see what I managed to do.
All in all, I'd say I didn't expect to find lattice gauge theory during this, which,
after some googling, seems to quite interesting.

Report on Ising dualities</a>**

Lemme see if I can add some more references to the discussion
(this one is primarily based on Kardar). David tong seemed to have nice lectures
on gauge theory.

P.s. - The xkcd pic is "meant" to promote digital minimalism ;).
