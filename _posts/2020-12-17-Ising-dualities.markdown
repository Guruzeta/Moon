I've put up posting this note for sometime. Here it is:

Recently I managed to read something on dualities in Ising model as a part of my
project for a course on Advanced statistical mechanics. The reading involved basically
going over a chapter in Kardar's book on series expansions. I didn't expect to find lattice gauge theory during this, which is quite interesting in its own right ;)

Here's my presentation on it:

A messy presentation</a>**

I am adding a set of references, mostly for some later time when I hope
to return to this: I found [Muramatsu's Notes](https://www.itp3.uni-stuttgart.de/downloads/Lattice_gauge_theory_SS_2009/Chapter3.pdf) quite useful, particularly the calculation
of vanishing local order parameter (or lack of SSB) in the gauge theory. Also check [Kogut's review](http://www.fulviofrisone.com/attachments/article/483/030818090032%20An%20Introduction%20To%20Lattice%20Gauge%20Theory%20And%20Spin%20Systems.pdf).
