Hi there!
I am an undergraduate student in Engineering Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I am primarily interested in theoretical physics. That said, I also like abstract mathematics and have some fondness for biology as well. Previously I've mostly explored general relativity and some differential geometry. Currently, i am most fascinated by QFT (if you haven;t heard of it, do give my post a read) and hopefully I won't have further phase transitions ;)

I've been fortunate to spend some time in Tata Institute of Fundamental Sciences(Mumbai) and at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (Bhubaneswar). For a glimpse

I also manage a hobby club, the <a href="http://mnp-club.github.io"><b>Maths and Physics Club</b></a>, aimed to spread the enthusiasm for basic sciences among the public.

You can checkout my CV for a glimpse into my exploits. Feel free to wander about!
