<!-- ## <center>  Guru Kalyan Jayasingh </center> -->
Hi there!
I am **Guru Kalyan Jayasingh**, a final year undergraduate in the Physics department at the
<a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in"><b>Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</b></a>. 	I am primarily interested in theoretical physics, particularly condensed matter physics. Mostly, I like
exploring
applications of field theory based methods to analyse many-body systems at equilibrium & non-equilibrium.
Currently, I am in the process of finishing my Master's thesis and am excited to further my journey via a PhD.
To know more about my work, see the posts section on my homepage.
 <!-- That said, I also like abstract mathematics and have some
fondness for biology as well. Previously I've mostly explored general relativity and differential geometry.
Currently, i am most fascinated by Quantum Field Theories (if you haven't heard of it, do give my post a read)
and hopefully I won't have further phase transitions of my interest in the near future ;) -->


<!-- I've been fortunate to spend some time in <a href="https://www.tifr.res.in"><b>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research(Mumbai)</b></a> and at the <a href="https://www.niser.ac.in"><b>National Institute of Science Education and Research (Bhubaneswar) </b></a> . Apart from the work that i did there, I grew a sense what working as a professional requires and I plan to become one someday (not too far though). -->

<!-- I also manage a hobby club, the <a href="http://mnp-club.github.io"><b>Maths and Physics Club</b></a>, aimed to spread the enthusiasm for basic sciences among the public. -->

Feel free to wander about!
